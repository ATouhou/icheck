icheck is a command line tool to recursively compute md5 sums for the current
directory. works a bit like md5deep but is more straightforward to use.

to compute md5 sums for the current directory put icheck.php in your $PATH
and type:

  icheck create

this will create the file md5sums with all filename/sum pairs in it. to check 
a directory which contains a md5sums file type:

  icheck check

the check command will report missing and broken files. md5sums-files
in subdirectories will be considered.



requirements: php 5.2+
